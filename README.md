Surviving from lots of midter and assignments, didn't get much time to work on this. But during the period, I did go through several templates and possible combination with Jekyll. But for the convinience and time consideration, for the current version will simply use provided css&javascript template and directly modify on HTML. Added template to
the repository, will start on fill in content next week. 
Template currently using: https://github.com/github/personal-website.
